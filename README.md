# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
The goal of this analysis was to perform exploratory analysis of Pyber ride sharing data in order to gain an understanding of ridership and fare metrics by the types of cities in which Pyber operates. creating visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Results
By reviewing the summary we can see that there are several key findings including:

* Urban cities have the highest ridership demand while rural cities have the least.
* Urban cities have 4x+ more drivers than suburban cities.
* Suburban cities have 6x + drivers than rural with almost 4.5x the revenue.
* Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and driver.

The summary data is particularly interesting as it suggests two things for both drivers and the company. For drivers, they are much more likely to make more money per fare in rural settings as there is a lower driver:rides ratio. This same ratio indicates that urban areas are far more profitable for the company as the ratio is much higher. Of course, this premised on the company taking a fixed percentage of the drivers' fares. 

## Summary
My Suggestions, based on the data, are as follows:
1.    Increase driver numbers in rural areas to reduce customer cost
2.    relocate drivers from Urban to Rural and Suburban areas during the months of March and April to achieve the goals in suggestion 1
3.    Acertain reasons for discrepancies in fare volume between 3 types in April and allocate drivers accordingly.
